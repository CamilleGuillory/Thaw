/// We use the term "source process" to refer to the process that created
/// a menu bar item. Originally, we used the CGWindowList API to get the
/// window's owning process (`kCGWindowOwnerPID`), which was always the
/// source process. However, as of macOS 26, item windows are owned by
/// the Control Center.
///
/// We can find what we need using the Accessibility API, but doing it
/// efficiently ends up being a fairly complex process. Since calls to
/// Accessibility are thread blocking, we do most of the heavy lifting
/// in a dedicated XPC service, which we then call asynchronously from
/// the main app.
